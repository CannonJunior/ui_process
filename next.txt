Add a new button next to the Matrix. This button will transition the canvas to a horizontal Timeline. This should display date cards, with a card for the current date centered in the middle of the display. Color the borders of date cards according to enumerated types in config. Initial types should include workdays, weekends, holidays, paydays, and milestone dates. Holidays will also be enumerated in config. Weekends are Saturdays and Sundays. Paydays are every two weeks on Fridays. Friday, August 8 is a payday, calculate other paydays from that baseline. Milestone dates will be configured by adding a new tag to tasks. While in the Timeline view, allow the scrollwheel to advance (scroll down) and retreat (scroll up) the calendar days.
