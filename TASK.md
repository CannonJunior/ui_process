## Current Task
**Task:** Implement web application for creating process flow diagrams
**Date Added:** 2025-07-27
**Description:** Create a web interface with dropdown for node types (Process, Decision, Terminal), draggable nodes, and right-click context menus for flowline creation, renaming, and deletion.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Basic project structure setup (2025-07-27)
- [x] HTML layout with dropdown and canvas (2025-07-27)
- [x] CSS styling for nodes and interface (2025-07-27)
- [x] JavaScript application with full functionality (2025-07-27)

## Task Status: COMPLETED
All core requirements from PLANNING.md have been implemented:
1. ✅ Dropdown with node types (Process, Decision, Terminal)
2. ✅ Visual representations (rectangle, diamond, rounded rectangle)
3. ✅ Drag functionality for nodes
4. ✅ Right-click context menu
5. ✅ Flowline creation between nodes
6. ✅ Node renaming functionality
7. ✅ Node deletion functionality

## Discovered During Work
- [x] Enhanced save/load workflow to preserve visual fidelity (2025-08-09)
  - Fixed CSS class restoration for proper node shapes and styling
  - Added visual properties (className, dimensions, computed styles) to saved data
  - Updated createNodeFromData() to restore exact visual appearance
  - Workflows now maintain identical appearance when loaded

- [x] Implemented fixed slot-based task positioning system (2025-08-09)
  - Tasks are no longer draggable and maintain fixed positions relative to anchor nodes
  - Added slot identifier system for predictable task positioning
  - Automatic gap removal when tasks are moved or deleted
  - Tasks are positioned in sequential slots below their anchor nodes
  - Slot information is preserved in save/load functionality
  - When tasks are moved to new nodes, old slots are compacted to remove gaps
  - Fixed task advancement to properly associate tasks with new anchor nodes
  - Enhanced slot assignment to exclude the task being moved from collision detection

- [x] Added task reversal functionality (2025-08-09)
  - Tasks now track their previous anchor node for potential reversal
  - Added "Reverse Task" option to task context menu
  - Tasks can be moved back to their previous node location
  - Reverse option only appears when a previous node exists
  - Previous anchor information is preserved in save/load functionality
  - Reversal uses the slot-based positioning system for consistent placement

- [x] Implemented comprehensive task tagging system (2025-08-09)
  - Created central configuration system (config.js) for all dropdown options
  - Refactored all hardcoded HTML dropdowns to use centralized configuration
  - Added five tag categories: Stage, BNB, BOE, Urgency, and Importance
  - Each category has predefined sub-options with cascading dropdown selection
  - Tag management modal with current tags display and removal capabilities
  - Color-coded tag display system with category-specific styling
  - Tags appear directly on task nodes with compact visual representation
  - One tag per category limit with automatic replacement of existing tags
  - Full save/load support preserving tag assignments across sessions
  - "Manage Tags" context menu option for easy tag assignment and editing

- [x] Implemented comprehensive responsive design system (2025-08-10)
  - Complete CSS rewrite with mobile-first responsive approach
  - Flexible grid system using CSS Grid and Flexbox for all components
  - Dynamic sizing using clamp() functions for fluid typography and spacing
  - Viewport-based responsive units (vw, vh) with min/max constraints
  - Comprehensive overflow prevention for all content containers
  - Text truncation and ellipsis for long content in constrained spaces
  - Responsive tag display with automatic wrapping and size adjustment
  - Mobile-optimized touch interactions and gesture support
  - Tablet and desktop breakpoints with adaptive layouts
  - Responsive modals with viewport-aware sizing and scrolling
  - Context menus with overflow protection and mobile optimization
  - High-DPI display support and print-friendly styles
  - Task nodes with dynamic height adjustment for tag content

- [x] Updated z-index layering to prevent task node obstruction (2025-08-10)
  - Established comprehensive z-index hierarchy documentation
  - Task nodes now have z-index: 50 (above regular nodes at z-index: 10)
  - Background elements (SVG flowlines) at z-index: 5
  - Dragging nodes at z-index: 1000 for temporary highest priority
  - Context menus at z-index: 2000, modals at z-index: 3000
  - Tasks are now always visible above regular nodes when overlapping
  - Maintained non-draggable behavior for task nodes as intended

- [x] Added thin outlines to task tag elements (2025-08-10)
  - All task tag elements now have a thin 1px outline
  - Outline color automatically matches the tag text color using currentColor
  - Applied to both task-specific tags and general tag elements
  - Improves visual definition and readability of tags
  - Maintains responsive design and accessibility

- [x] Ensured full vertical visibility of all task content (2025-08-10)
  - Removed max-height restrictions from .task-tags container
  - Updated task nodes to display all associated tags without clipping
  - Increased node text max-height from 3em to 5em for better content display
  - Modified decision nodes to use min-height instead of fixed height
  - All task content now expands vertically as needed
  - Maintained responsive design and proper spacing between elements
  - Added proper margin spacing for tag containers
  - Modal tag areas retain controlled scrolling for space efficiency
