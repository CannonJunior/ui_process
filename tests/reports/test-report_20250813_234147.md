# Test Pipeline Report

**Generated:** Wed 13 Aug 2025 11:41:54 PM EDT  
**Pipeline:** Automated Test Runner  
**Version:** Week 1 Foundation Preparation  

## Summary

This report documents the execution of the comprehensive test suite for the Process Flow Designer refactoring project.

## Test Suite Coverage

### Core Functionality Tests (Target: >95%)
- Node management (creation, positioning, types)
- Task management (creation, tagging, slots)
- Eisenhower Matrix (toggle, positioning, analysis)
- State management and serialization

### UI Components Tests (Target: >90%)
- Modal management (task, tag, advance modals)
- Context menus (node, task, tag actions)
- Drag and drop functionality
- Form validation and keyboard interactions

### Integration Tests (Target: >85%)
- Complete workflow testing
- Save/load cycle integrity
- Cross-component communication
- Error recovery and edge cases

## Test Infrastructure

### Files Created
- `tests/test-suite.html` - Main test runner interface
- `tests/core-functionality.test.js` - Core functionality tests
- `tests/ui-components.test.js` - UI component tests
- `tests/integration.test.js` - Integration workflow tests
- `tests/test-runner.js` - Automated pipeline runner

### Framework
- **Mocha**: Test framework for BDD-style tests
- **Chai**: Assertion library for readable test expectations
- **Custom TestUtils**: Mock DOM creation and cleanup utilities

## Safety Measures

✅ Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring  
✅ Automated pipeline for continuous validation  
✅ Mock DOM environment for isolated testing  
✅ Quality gates for pass rates and coverage  

## Next Steps (Week 1)

1. ✅ Create comprehensive test suite
2. ✅ Set up automated testing pipeline
3. 🔄 Create rollback scripts for immediate reversion
4. ⏳ Document all current method signatures and public interfaces
5. ⏳ Create feature branch for refactoring work

## Usage

To run tests manually:
```bash
# Run this script
./run-tests.sh

# Or open in browser
open tests/test-suite.html
```

To run automated pipeline:
```javascript
// In browser console
testRunner.runAutomatedPipeline();
```

## Quality Gates

- Minimum pass rate: 95%
- Minimum coverage: 85%
- Maximum failures: 0
