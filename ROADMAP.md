# UI Process Roadmap

## ðŸ“‹ Active Development TODOs

### Chat System Improvements

- [ ] **Remove Command Suggestion Functionality** (Added: 2025-09-04)
  - **Status**: In Progress 
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Description**: Command suggestion functionality has been disabled in chat-interface.js (lines 550-555). This system was automatically generating and executing commands based on user input, which interfered with the intended chat experience.
  - **Next Steps**:
    - Complete removal of all command suggestion code
    - Ensure regular (non-escaped) input is properly routed to Ollama LLM
    - Remove unused command analysis methods and dependencies
    - Clean up related UI elements and event handlers
  - **Files Affected**:
    - `chat-interface.js` (command suggestion logic disabled)
    - Related MCP service files (review for cleanup)
  - **Reason for Removal**: User explicitly requested to "completely turn off all command suggestion functionality and mark it for possible deletion" as it was interfering with normal chat operation.
