Go into research mode. We would like to add a note taking capability to the chat interface. This would allow for a command that the system recognizes to invoke a command line argument, instead of sending the input to be processed by the llm. Research note taking command line applications. Start with nb, documented here: https://github.com/xwmx/nb. Research alternative note taking applications. Develop a plan that would enable integration a capability such as nb into the web application's chat interface. Investigate options for saving data created through nb in the web application's interface. Will will be adding an organizational object higher than a task, called Opportunities. Opportunities may have multiple tasks in different workflows associated. Think through how to leverage nb and capabilities like nb tags that would help associate tasks, nb created notes, and other data with an Opportunity, either by using an LLM or another method, without the user having to create these associated manually. Create an analysis of alternatives to nb and an implementation plan before writing and code.
