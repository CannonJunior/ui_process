# Process Flow Designer - Implementation Status

## Project Overview
This is a web application for creating interactive process flow diagrams. The application supports multiple node types, flowline connections, and advanced task management features.

## ‚úÖ Core Features Implemented

### Node System
- **Node Types**: Process (rectangle), Decision (diamond), Terminal (rounded rectangle), Task (small rectangle)
- **Node Creation**: Dropdown menu for creating Process, Decision, and Terminal nodes
- **Default Start Node**: Automatically creates a "Start" terminal node on application load
- **Drag & Drop**: All nodes are draggable with left-click and mouse movement
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects and visual indicators during interactions

### Flowline System
- **Connection Types**: Straight lines and perpendicular (right-angled) lines
- **Creation Method**: Right-click ‚Üí "Create Flowline" ‚Üí double-click target node
- **Flowline Type Selection**: Dropdown to choose between straight and perpendicular lines
- **Visual Feedback**: Source node glows blue during flowline creation mode
- **SVG Implementation**: Professional arrows with proper arrowheads
- **Center-to-Center Connections**: Flowlines connect at node centers

### Context Menus
**Standard Nodes (Process, Decision, Terminal):**
- Create Flowline to another node
- Change node name (inline editing)
- Delete node (removes node and connected flowlines)

**Task Nodes:**
- Advance Task (move along flowlines)
- Change name (inline editing)  
- Delete Task (specialized task removal)

### Task Management System
- **Add Task Button**: Dedicated button in toolbar for creating tasks
- **Modal Dialog**: Professional input modal for task name entry
- **Smart Positioning**: Tasks automatically position below their anchor node
- **Anchor Relationships**: Tasks reference and are tied to specific process nodes
- **Synchronized Movement**: When anchor nodes are dragged, all attached tasks move together
- **Task Advancement**: Tasks can progress along flowlines to connected nodes

### Advanced Task Features
- **Single Path Advancement**: Automatic progression when anchor has one outbound flowline
- **Multi-Path Selection**: Modal dialog for choosing destination when multiple flowlines exist
- **Smart Re-anchoring**: Tasks update their anchor reference when advanced
- **Collision Avoidance**: Tasks position with proper spacing to prevent overlap

## üé® User Interface
- **Clean Toolbar**: Node type dropdown, Add Task button, flowline type selector
- **Grid Background**: Visual grid for alignment assistance
- **Professional Modals**: Task creation and advancement selection dialogs
- **Responsive Design**: Proper event handling and visual feedback
- **Context-Sensitive Menus**: Different options based on node type

## üîß Technical Implementation
- **Modular JavaScript**: Clean class-based architecture with ProcessFlowDesigner
- **SVG Graphics**: Scalable vector graphics for flowlines and arrows
- **Event Management**: Comprehensive mouse, keyboard, and UI event handling
- **Data Relationships**: Proper node-to-task anchoring with data attributes
- **State Management**: Tracking of nodes, flowlines, tasks, and UI states

## üöÄ Workflow Examples

### Basic Process Creation
1. Use dropdown to create Process, Decision, and Terminal nodes
2. Drag nodes to desired positions
3. Right-click ‚Üí "Create Flowline" ‚Üí double-click target to connect nodes
4. Right-click nodes to rename or delete as needed

### Task Management Workflow
1. Click "Add Task" button in toolbar
2. Enter task name in modal dialog
3. Task appears below Start node
4. Right-click task ‚Üí "Advance Task" to move along process flow
5. Choose destination if multiple paths available
6. Task moves and re-anchors to new node

### Advanced Features
- Tasks automatically follow their anchor nodes when dragged
- Flowlines update dynamically during node movement
- Multiple flowline types (straight/perpendicular) for different diagram styles
- Professional visual feedback throughout all interactions

## üéØ Current State
The application is fully functional with a comprehensive feature set suitable for creating professional process flow diagrams with integrated task tracking and management capabilities.
